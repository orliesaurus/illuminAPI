Empowering your API design process with best practices

#Vision
The purpose of this repo is collate all the best practices I find from offline and online sources into an easy to read, developer friendly set of principles around API topics.
#Purpose
Too many times you hear developers arguing on design principles for APIs. The purpose is to find real-life examples and analyse and discuss each approach's pros and cons, with focus on what has everyone achieved.
