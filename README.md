Empowering your API design process with best practices

#Vision
The purpose of this repo is collate all API best practices I find from offline and online sources into an easy to read, developer friendly set of principles around API topics.
#Purpose
Too many times you hear developers arguing on design principles for APIs. The purpose of this project is to find real-life examples and analyse and discuss each approach. Weighing up the pros and cons, focussing on data: If an API is popular there's a reason to why that is. They might have designed the API in a way that most developers agree with. To me this is success, and leads to setting best practices.
#This is not
A document that explains what is an API, why you need to have an API, what is JSON, is JSON better than XML etc. There are tons of resources to discuss and debate this purpose. Just google them.
